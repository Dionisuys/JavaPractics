<p>An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.</p>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre><code>
<p>Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]</p>
<h4>Output: 3</h4>
<p>Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with 
area = 3.</p>
</code></pre>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre><code>
<p>Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]</p>
<h4>Output: 4</h4>
<p>Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island 
with area = 4.</p>
</code></pre>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>
